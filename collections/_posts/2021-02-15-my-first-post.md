Hello! this is my first post and I am really happy to finally be able to write something. It took me way longer than I expected but along the way I gained a lot of experience which makes me happy. 

Before I begin to ramble about why it took me way longer than expected. I will instead save that for another post and I will talk about the purpose of me creating this website.

## The purpose
I created this website with the purpose in mind to self document my progress. This way, I can become a better programmer and hopefully my content is also able to help others who come across my website.
